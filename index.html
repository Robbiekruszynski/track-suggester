        <h4><u>Epicodus Expectation</u></h4>
        <p>Epicodus is nothing like a traditional classroom: it's 100% hands-on, building projects and writing code all day, every day. There are no lectures, breakout sessions, lightning talks, or anything like that.<b>The best way to learn coding is to code, and that's what we spend our programming classes doing.</b></p>
        <p>Most class days, you'll practice pair programming: two people sharing one computer, taking turns who uses the keyboard and mouse. By working together, you catch each other's mistakes, teach each other new skills, and come up with ideas together neither of you would have had alone. Pairing is increasingly used by tech companies (like Facebook and Square), and we've found that pair programming helps you learn programming concepts faster, too.<p>
        <p>If you're in a full-time programming course, on Fridays, you'll work alone on a project that teachers provide feedback on individually the following week. For evening courses, you'll complete this project on your own time and receive your feedback via email.</p>

For example, Rails' popularity inspired copycats in just about every language, and so you'll see interactive web applications written in C#, Java, and PHP, with Rails-like frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and Laravel. Even at one company, you might find them using PHP for their marketing site, Ruby for their web application, and Java for their back-end processing.</p>
