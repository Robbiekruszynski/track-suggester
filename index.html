        <h4><u>Epicodus Expectation</u></h4>
        <p>Epicodus is nothing like a traditional classroom: it's 100% hands-on, building projects and writing code all day, every day. There are no lectures, breakout sessions, lightning talks, or anything like that.<b>The best way to learn coding is to code, and that's what we spend our programming classes doing.</b></p>
        <p>Most class days, you'll practice pair programming: two people sharing one computer, taking turns who uses the keyboard and mouse. By working together, you catch each other's mistakes, teach each other new skills, and come up with ideas together neither of you would have had alone. Pairing is increasingly used by tech companies (like Facebook and Square), and we've found that pair programming helps you learn programming concepts faster, too.<p>
        <p>If you're in a full-time programming course, on Fridays, you'll work alone on a project that teachers provide feedback on individually the following week. For evening courses, you'll complete this project on your own time and receive your feedback via email.</p>

FULL-TIME PROGRAMMING COURSES
Epicodus offers full-time courses in languages such as C#, JavaScript, Ruby, and more. Every track starts with Introduction to Programming, and includes an advanced JavaScript course, as well as two language-specific courses â€” four five-week sessions in total. In addition, students complete two weeks of job and internship prep and finish their studies with a five-week internship. Here is a snapshot, in terms of hours:

800 hours in class 80 hours job and intership prep / intership 150 hours internship learning

CC# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.

JAVA
Java is also a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn.

PHP
PHP is by far the most popular backend language today, with 80 percent of websites utilizing it 'server-side'. It is perhaps best known for it's use in content management systems like Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla. But the versatility of the language and the frameworks it powers make employment options numerous and diverse. If you're keen to work for a fast paced agency that builds websites for lots of clients, or maintain the security and stability of a huge complex of government websites, or if you like the idea of building out small sites for brands, businesses, and organizations - In any of these cases, PHP would be a great way to go.

RUBY
Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.

Though each language has its niche, there is plenty of crossover. For example, Rails' popularity inspired copycats in just about every language, and so you'll see interactive web applications written in C#, Java, and PHP, with Rails-like frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and Laravel. Even at one company, you might find them using PHP for their marketing site, Ruby for their web application, and Java for their back-end processing.
